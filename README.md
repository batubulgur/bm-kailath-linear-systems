## DjVu bookmark for Kailath's Linear Systems 
You know where to find the book. I suggest you use the .djvu version.

.pdf version is of poor quality and I am not hopeful with any OCR results.

Thus using the .djvu version makes sense. Since the book is relatively long and depends heavily on references on different chapters, I thought that a bookmark would be useful for the reader. Thus spent couple hours to write it since I constantly check the book for reference.

Please disseminate. If you find any errors please report.

You will need DjVuLibre. On Windows you need to add the install path to your environmental variables and to your `%PATH%` unless you want cmd.exe 10 line command cancer.
```
 djvused kailath.djvu -e "set-outline kailath.bm" -s
